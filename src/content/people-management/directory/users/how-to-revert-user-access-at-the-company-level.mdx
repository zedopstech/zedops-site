### **Revert a User’s Access**

1. In the **User List** table, find the user whose access you want to revoke.
2. Click the **"Revert User"** button next to their name.
3. A confirmation popup will appear.

---

### **Confirm Reversion**

- Review the user's details.
- Click **Confirm** to remove their login access and revert them to a non-user state.

> ⚠️ Note: After reversion, the user will no longer be able to log in unless access is granted again.
