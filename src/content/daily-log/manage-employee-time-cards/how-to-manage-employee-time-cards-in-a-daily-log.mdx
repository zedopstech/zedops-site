### **Assign Employees to the Site**

- Here, you’ll see a list of **employees currently on-site** (if already assigned).
- You can **add employees** to the site by selecting from the list or searching by name.
- This helps log who is physically present on the site for that day.

### **Add Notes**

Use the notes section to add important observations:

- **Employee Work Notes** – Log any specific notes about work progress, behavior, or tasks done by employees.
- **Visitor Notes** – Record any external visitors, their purpose, and duration on site.
- **Other Notes** – Mention anything relevant outside the above categories (e.g., special events, inspections, safety checks).

### **View Employee Time Card Logs**

Below the assignment and notes section, you can view real-time **employee time card details**:

- **Employee Name**
- **Check-in Time**
- **Check-out Time**
- **Total Hours Worked**
- **Current Status** (e.g., Checked-out, Checked-out, Paused)

This helps supervisors monitor attendance, working hours, and workforce allocation per day.
